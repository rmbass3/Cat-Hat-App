# Cat-Hat-App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a web project I'm working on in order to learn React.

## Add Hats to Cats

What more could you want?

Just drag the hats onto the cat's head. Simple enough.

Choose from different sets of cats, hats and backgrounds.

Use the random button for inspiration.

Mobile-friendly!
